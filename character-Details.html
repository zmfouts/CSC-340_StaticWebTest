    <h2>First Appeared in Episode 1, as he's the Main Character of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No yabai</h2>
    <p>Sun breathing is the original breathing technique in the Demon Slayer world. All other Breathing Styles are derived from it as the result of Yoriichi Tsugikuni, its creator, modifying it to suit the individuals he taught who were unable to use it. Sun Breathing users are very rare to come across, but has been internalized into Tanjiro's family through the Hinokami Kagura, a dance passed down through the Kamado family that uses a breathing technique that never lets the user run out of air. It's the most powerful breathing technique of them all.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Personality: Tanjiro is very kind by nature and has been described by others as having very gentle eyes and a compassionate persona. He exhibits a great deal of determination and will not give up once he has a goal to achieve; the best example of this is his relentless quest to find a cure for Nezuko. Even though he is relatively strong on his own, Tanjiro isn't opposed to asking others for help when he needs it. He is very protective of his friends, and especially so of his younger sister. However, despite his kind and understanding nature, Tanjiro does have a limit to his tolerance and has a distaste for rudeness and cowardice, as he easily becomes annoyed by Zenitsu Agatsuma's constant whining and angered by Inosuke Hashibira's barbaric actions.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Backstory: Tanjiro was born on a mountain as the eldest son of Kie and Tanjuro Kamado, a family of charcoal sellers. After his five younger siblings were born, he adopted the idea that, as the oldest child, he should be strong and endure any hardships for them. Although the family did not enjoy a lavish lifestyle, they lived happily and showed a great deal of love and care for one another. Growing up, Tanjiro learned coal-burning techniques and was responsible for selling charcoal in the nearest town in order to earn money for his family. He appeared to frequent the town quite often, as the civilians there easily recognized him and regularly asked for his help. Tanjiro's father was a major influence on him and acted as his teacher for the foundations of the Hinokami Kagura, a ritual dance that was passed down across the family's generations alongside a pair of hanafuda earrings, and Tanjiro would often watch him perform this dance. Upon asking Tanjuro about his stamina despite the cold weather, Tanjiro learned from his father that there were specific breathing techniques to continue dancing endlessly. When Tanjiro grew old enough to dance in place of his weakening father, he learned that the correct techniques would allow him to blank his mind, enter a plant-like state, and gain access to the see-through world. Before Tanjuro passed away, a night with the threat of a hungry bear prompted him to show Tanjiro the state in action. Tanjiro was frightened at the sight of the predator, but his father quickly killed it with his axe upon entering the state. Tanjuro's abilities shocked him, and Tanjiro made sure to remember the event. Soon after, Tanjuro passed, and Tanjiro's younger siblings began treating him as their father figure.</p>
