    <p>Demon Slayer is a show that I didn't realize would catch my heart so fast and with such a strong grip. Originally, I was just watching it because it was my best friend's favorite anime. But having taken the journey through Demon Slayer, it's become a show very dear to my heart with its various lessons in teamwork, family, and growing as a person. I have also grown particularly attached to the characters presented on the website, so I wanted to present some information about them to present my love for this show. The characters presented are not necessarily the top 5 most important characters of the show, but are the younglings from season 1 that improve as the story progresses through the different seasons and hardship helps develops the kids as the years pass. The kids constantly push beyond their limits and inspire me to make light of the good, in spite of the current state of things and to make the most of what I can. To surpass my limits and learn as much as I can. I've also been taught especially to uphold my morals in tough times, and to hold true to what I feel is right.</p>
